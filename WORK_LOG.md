I'm honestly kinda confused on where to go as I can't really think of any immediate ways to compress binary code. |

What I do know is that I need to figure out a way to compress the binary into patterns that I'll be able to decipher later on. I'm currently thinking of using the zeros within the code to determine the compression of the entire sequence. |

I'm not too sure on which one but for now I am thinking of using 8 zeros in a row as a starting point. I used the time in class to start working on my new code for this algorithm. |
| Nov 20 |   3-4:30 PM   |                                I continued to work on my compress, for now I am going with the idea of setting each up a counter for the amount of 0s before switching to 1s. The main problem I see with this is that it is going to be hard to differentiate between which 0s were left over from counting by 8s. I was going to try to work around this by setting up a special counter. |
| Nov 22 | 12:35-1:45 PM | I decided to switch my idea to more fit the theory of bitmap by making it so that my compress would instead count the amounts of 0s before encountering a 1, then it would save that int and write it as a byte. Then it would switch and do the same thing for 1s. What I would then do is simply read the 8 bit number and write out either the amounts of 0s/1s stored within that byte. |
